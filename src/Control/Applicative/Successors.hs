Description : Successor Functor

A value of type @'Succs' a@ represents a step in a graph with nodes of type @a@, or in other words, a node plus the list of its successors.

The 'Applicative' instance for @'Succs' a@ is such that the node represented by @a '<*>' b@ is the application of the node of @a@ applied to the node of @b@, and (more importantly) the successors modeled by @a '<*>' b@ are the node of @a@ applied to the succesors of @b@ in addition to the succesors of @a@ applied to the node of @b@. This way, at most one step is taken.

>>> (++) <$> Succs "0" ["1","2"] <*> Succs "A" ["B","C"]
Succs "0A" ["1A","2A","0B", "0C"]

>>> skip x = Succs [x] [[]]
>>> getSuccs $ (concat <$> traverse skip "Hello")
["ello","Hllo","Helo","Helo","Hell"]

This applicative functor can be useful to define shrink functions for QuickCheck, using the helper

> shrinkSuccs x = Succs x (shrink x)

as explained in a <http://stackoverflow.com/a/41944525/946226 StackExchange answer.>
